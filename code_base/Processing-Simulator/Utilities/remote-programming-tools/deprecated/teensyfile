random comment line; doesn't need to start with #

can comments have : in them?

234:thisfile.hex

yes, they can!  They can even have node ids like 234 in them...

but they can't have node ids followed by colons, like 12345: that will break things (actually it doesn't, but I don't know why so don't do it)

what happens if a teensy appears twice?
