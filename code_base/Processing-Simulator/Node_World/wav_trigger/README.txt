The configuration file found in this folder is used to initialize the WAV trigger.  If you wish to play just simple tracks, you must include this file along with your tracks (include within the
microSD card).  Also, "#include" this file when uploading code directing which tracks to play off the SD card.  

It is a simple configuration file which sets the volume of the speaker based on a scale from +20 dB to -70 dB.  Also, it initializes the amplifier in the speaker through the "SPKR 1" command.
Do not set this to 0, or else you will not hear anything from the speaker when atatched to the WAV trigger.

The configuration file can be found in the folder within this current folder.  There are also sample tracks which you can play, also included on the SD cards on your WAV triggers.
