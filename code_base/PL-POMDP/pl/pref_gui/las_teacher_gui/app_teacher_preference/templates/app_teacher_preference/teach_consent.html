        <p class="infoText">Dear Potential Participant,<br><br>
            You are invited to participate in a research study about Human-Robot Interaction
            conducted by Lingheng Meng. It will be used as part of Lingheng's PhD study. This
            project is supervised by Dr. Dana Kulić at the Department of Electrical and Computer
            Engineering and Dr. Rob Gorbet at the Department of Knowledge Integration at the
            University of Waterloo, Canada. This study aims to study how users can guide
            interactive system behaviour by indicating their preferences of which one of two video
            clips of the interactions between the visitors and the sculpture they prefer.
        </p>

        <p><b>Study details</b>: If you decide to participate, your participation would involve one on-line
            session. Firstly, you will be shown pairs of short videos and, for
            each pair, asked to choose which one you prefer. You can view as many pairs of videos
            as you wish and go to the survey anytime by clicking the “Go to Survey” button. Each video is approximately 5 seconds. In the 2<sup>nd</sup> part of the session, you will be
            asked to complete a <b>2 minute</b> questionnaire about your experience of providing your
            preference of the video clip and you may decline to answer any question(s) you prefer not to answer.
            There are no known or anticipated risks to participation in this study. Your participation in
            this study is voluntary and anonymous.   </p>

        <p><b>Location and Date</b>: The study will take place online at
            <a href="https://las-ai.uk.r.appspot.com"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span> https://las-ai.uk.r.appspot.com</a>,
            anytime from <b>[XXX date placeholder will be filled after approved]</b> to
            <b>[XXX date placeholder will be filled after approved]</b> .</p>

        <p><b>Eligibility Requirements for Participation</b>: Potential participants must be over 18 to participate. </p>

        <p><b>Confidentiality and Data Retention</b>: No names or other identifying information will be collected on
            the surveys. While aggregated results may be used in theses or publications, only researchers will have
            access to the data. Your name will not appear in any publication resulting from this study. However,
            with your permission, anonymous quotations may be used in the thesis or any publications. You will be
            completing the study by an online survey deployed on Google Cloud. When information is transmitted over
            the internet privacy cannot be guaranteed. There is always a risk your responses may be intercepted by
            a third party (e.g., government agencies, hackers). University of Waterloo researchers will not collect
            or use internet protocol (IP) addresses or other information which could link your participation to your
            computer or electronic device without first informing you. The data collected from this study will be downloaded
            from Google Cloud and maintained on a password protected, disk encrypted laptop. All the data will be
            electronically archived after completion of the study and maintained for a minimum of 8 years. Once your data is submitted, you cannot withdraw your consent to participate as the researchers
            have no way of identifying which data is yours. </p>

        <p><b>Ethic Review and Clearance</b>: This study has been reviewed and received ethics clearance through a University of Waterloo Research Ethics Committee (ORE#42436).
            If you have questions for the Committee contact the Office of Research Ethics, at <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-phone"></span> 1-519-888-4567 ext. 36005 or ohrac@uwaterloo.ca. </p>

        <p><b>Questions and Contact</b>: If you have any questions or would like additional information regarding this study,
            please contact Lingheng via email. Also, if you prefer, you may contact my faculty supervisors Dr. Dana Kulić
            and Dr. Rob Gorbet, who are professors at the University of Waterloo, via their emails and/or phone numbers.</p>
